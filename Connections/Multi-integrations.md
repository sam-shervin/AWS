- **Workflow**:
  - **Data Ingestion**: IoT devices send data to AWS IoT Core.
  - **Streaming**: IoT Core streams data to Kinesis Data Streams for real-time processing.
  - **Processing**: Lambda functions process the streaming data.
  - **Storage**: Processed data is stored in DynamoDB for fast access or in S3 for long-term storage.

### 8. **Content Management System (CMS)**

- **Services Used**: Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon S3, Amazon CloudFront, AWS Lambda
- **Workflow**:
  - **CMS Hosting**: The CMS application is hosted on EC2 instances with dynamic content stored in RDS.
  - **Static Assets**: Static content such as images and videos are stored in S3 and delivered through CloudFront.
  - **Content Processing**: Lambda functions can be used for processing or transforming content before it’s stored in S3.

### 9. **Real-Time Notifications and Alerts**

- **Services Used**: Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Lambda, Amazon SNS, Amazon S3
- **Workflow**:
  - **Monitoring**: CloudWatch monitors application metrics and generates alarms based on thresholds.
  - **Event Handling**: CloudWatch triggers Lambda functions when alarms are activated.
  - **Notifications**: Lambda functions send alerts or notifications via SNS.
  - **Logs**: Lambda functions store logs or metrics in S3 for historical analysis.

### 10. **Data Warehousing and Analytics**

- **Services Used**: Amazon Redshift, Amazon S3, AWS Glue, Amazon QuickSight
- **Workflow**:
  - **Data Storage**: Raw data is stored in S3.
  - **ETL Processing**: AWS Glue extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) data from S3 into Amazon Redshift.
  - **Data Warehousing**: Redshift provides scalable data warehousing for complex queries and analytics.
  - **Visualization**: Amazon QuickSight is used for data visualization and creating dashboards from Redshift data.

### 11. **DevOps Pipeline**

- **Services Used**: AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy, Amazon EC2, Amazon S3
- **Workflow**:
  - **Source Control**: Code is stored in a source repository like AWS CodeCommit or GitHub.
  - **Build**: AWS CodeBuild compiles and tests code.
  - **Deployment**: CodeDeploy automates deployment to EC2 instances or ECS.
  - **Artifacts**: Build artifacts are stored in S3 and used for deployment or further testing.

### 12. **Data Migration**

- **Services Used**: AWS Data Migration Service (DMS), Amazon RDS, Amazon S3, AWS Lambda
- **Workflow**:
  - **Data Extraction**: DMS extracts data from a source database.
  - **Transformation**: Lambda functions can process or transform the data as it’s being migrated.
  - **Data Storage**: The transformed data is stored in S3 or directly loaded into Amazon RDS.

### 13. **Email and SMS Notifications**

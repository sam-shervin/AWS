  - **Scalability**: SNS can handle high throughput of messages and distribute them to multiple SQS queues or endpoints, allowing scalable processing.
- **Support for Message Delivery**:
  - **Publish-Subscribe Model**: SNS enables a publish-subscribe model where messages are published to an SNS topic and then delivered to one or more SQS queues.
  - **Asynchronous Processing**: SQS queues store messages until they are processed by consumers (e.g., EC2 instances or Lambda functions), enabling asynchronous and reliable processing.

### 5. **How can Amazon RDS be used to support a high-availability application? What features of RDS contribute to its high-availability architecture?**

**Answer:**

- **Support for High Availability**:

  - **Read Replicas**: For read-heavy workloads, RDS supports read replicas to offload read traffic from the primary database and improve performance.
  - **Automated Backups**: RDS performs automated backups and enables point-in-time recovery to restore the database to any specific time within the backup retention period.
- **Features for High Availability**:
  - **Automatic Failover**: Multi-AZ deployments provide automatic failover to the standby instance in case of primary instance failure.
  - **Maintenance Windows**: Regular maintenance and patching are performed during defined maintenance windows to ensure system stability and security.

### 6. **How can Amazon VPC be used to enhance the security of an application hosted on EC2 instances? What are the key components of VPC that contribute to this security?**

**Answer:**

- **Enhancing Security**:
  - **Network Isolation**: VPC provides a logically isolated network environment where you can define your own IP address range, subnets, and route tables.
  - **Security Groups and Network ACLs**: Security Groups act as virtual firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances. Network ACLs provide additional layers of security at the subnet level.
  - **Private Subnets**: EC2 instances can be placed in private subnets with no direct access to the internet, reducing exposure to potential threats.
  - **VPN and Direct Connect**: Securely connect on-premises networks to VPC using VPN or AWS Direct Connect for encrypted data transmission and secure communication.

### 7. **In what ways can Amazon S3 Glacier be used to optimize storage costs for infrequently accessed data? How does Glacier fit into a broader data management strategy?**

Services categorized by their service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, etc.):

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

1. **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. You can launch virtual servers (instances) and configure them as needed.
2. **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Allows you to create a private network within AWS, control network configurations, and manage IP addresses and routing.
3. **Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)** (optional): Provides block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances.
4. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Offers scalable object storage with high durability and availability.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

1. **AWS Lambda**: Allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume.
2. **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Manages and operates relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, and MariaDB.
3. **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)**: Manages containerized applications, supporting Docker containers and providing scheduling and scaling capabilities.
4. **Amazon DynamoDB**: A fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

- **None of the services listed are traditional SaaS offerings**, as they focus more on infrastructure and platform services rather than end-user applications.

### Storage and Archiving

1. **Amazon S3 Glacier**: Provides long-term archival storage with retrieval options, designed for data that is infrequently accessed.

### Messaging and Notification

1. **Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)**: A fully managed message queuing service that enables decoupling and scaling of microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.
2. **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)**: A fully managed notification service that allows you to send messages to multiple endpoints or clients.

### Monitoring and Management

- **AWS CloudWatch** (optional): Provides monitoring and observability for AWS cloud resources and applications, including metrics, logs, and alarms.

### Backup and Recovery

- **AWS Backup** (optional): A fully managed backup service that centralizes and automates the backup of data across AWS services.
